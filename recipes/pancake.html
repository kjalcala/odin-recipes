        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A pancake is a breakfast dish, a flat cake that's made by pouring batter into a hot pan and frying it on both sides. Many people like to eat their pancakes with a drizzle of maple syrup. While pancakes can be savory, they're more often a sweet breakfast food in the US.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Gather ingredients and preheat oven:</h3>
                Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Have a baking sheet or heatproof platter ready to keep cooked pancakes warm in the oven.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Mix dry ingredients:</h3>
                In a small bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Mix wet ingredients:</h3>
                In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter (or oil), and egg.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</h3>
                Add dry ingredients to milk mixture; whisk until just moistened. (Do not overmix; a few small lumps are fine.)
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Heat and oil skillet or griddle:</h3>
                Heat a large skillet (nonstick or cast-iron) or griddle over medium. Fold a sheet of paper towel in half, and moisten with oil; carefully rub skillet with oiled paper towel.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Spoon batter onto skillet or griddle:</h3>
                For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet, using the back of the spoon to spread batter into a round (you should be able to fit 2 to 3 in a large skillet).
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Cook first side:</h3>
                Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have burst, 1 to 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Flip pancakes:</h3>
                Flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until browned on the underside, 1 to 2 minutes more.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Serve immediately, or keep warm in oven:</h3>
                Transfer to a baking sheet or platter; cover loosely with aluminum foil, and keep warm in oven. Continue with more oil and remaining batter. (You'll have 12 to 15 pancakes.) Serve warm, with desired toppings.
